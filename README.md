# turtle-project
This program draws 3 distinct patterns. The first being a row of shapes that take the input of the user and use them to colour in the shapes. The second pattern is a 
triangle spiral that takes the input of the user for the colour and canvas size. The triangle spiral will only continue until it covers approximately 70% of the canvas
at which it will stop.
The 3rd program are cubes that take the input of the user for colours and will use that input to colour in the sides of the cubes. The pattern draws cubes stacked upon 
each other
